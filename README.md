# Terraform Template Repository for Single Environment Deployment

This repository serves as a template for deploying infrastructure using Terraform in a single environment setup. Below is an overview of the directory structure and the purpose of each file:

## Directory Structure

- **modules/**: This directory stores reusable Terraform modules that define specific sets of resources or configurations. Modules help in organizing infrastructure code and promoting reusability.

- **main.tf**: The main configuration file where Terraform resources and modules are declared. This file orchestrates the deployment of infrastructure by calling appropriate modules and defining necessary configurations.

- **metadata.tf**: This file contains declarations for metadata and tags associated with the infrastructure resources. Tags are used for organizing and identifying resources, aiding in management and tracking.

- **version.tf**: This file specifies the versions of Terraform and providers used in the project. Keeping track of versions ensures consistency and compatibility across environments.

- **variables.tf**: Here, variables used throughout the Terraform configuration are declared. Variables allow for customization and parameterization of the infrastructure, making the configuration more flexible and reusable.

- **backend.tf**: Configuration for Terraform backend, which defines where state files are stored. This file specifies the backend type (like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.) and its configurations such as bucket names, key prefixes, and access credentials.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Customize the Terraform configuration files according to your infrastructure requirements, modifying variables, backend configurations, and resource definitions as needed.

3. Initialize Terraform in the project directory:

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

4. Plan the deployment to preview the changes Terraform will make:

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

5. Apply the Terraform configuration to create or update the infrastructure:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

6. After making changes to the configuration, always remember to commit and push them back to the repository for version control and collaboration:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update Terraform configuration"
    git push origin main
    ```
